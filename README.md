## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Course Description
This was the course I took in summer of 2023 at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster under CTY. It was a 3-week course, and we learned about data structures and algorithms. We learned about various ADTs and Data Structures. We also learned about many algorithms: such as graph traversal, sorting, searching, Prim's, and Dijkstra's. We learned about Big-O notation and how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms. We also learned about recursion and dynamic programming. We used JavaScript to implement the data structures and algorithms we learned about.

### The Projects
- `Project 1`: In this project, I modified a drawing tool that previously functioned using an array to keep track of items to using a linked list. 
- `Project 2`: In this project, I built on the previous project and utilized a binary search tree to name shapes, and sort them alphabetically.
- `Project 3`: In this project, I built on the previous project and utilized Huffman Compression to compress and decompress shapes which are now stored in a min-heap.
- `AI`: I built a shallow AI to play checkers which ran on my instructor Mr. Brian Sea's AI framework. I used the minmax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening, and almost implemented a quiescent search. The goal was to pit our AI's against each other in a tournament, and my AI won. In the end, it was my heuristics that won us the tournament. 

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to my instructor Mr. Brian Sea and my TA Jianan Xu. Thank you also to everyone who was in my class, it was a great experience.
